## Overview

This tool provides personalized dietary recommendations by analyzing baseline characteristics and early response data, predicting optimal strategies for visceral fat reduction. Based on a seven-arm randomized clinical trial with a within-subject control design, it offers evidence-based guidance to enhance metabolic health in young adults with normal weight through targeted interventions.

## Features

- 🔬 **RCT-Based**: Built on evidence from a rigorous randomized clinical trial, ensuring validated metabolic outcomes.
- 🧠 **LLM-Augmented**: Leveraging advanced Large Language Model technology to deliver tailored, data-driven recommendations.
- 🎯 **Personalized**: Providing individualized predictions based on unique participant profiles for optimized metabolic health outcomes.

## Research Foundation

This tool is built on a seven-arm randomized clinical trial that evaluated the effects of various dietary regimens, including calorie restriction and intermittent fasting, on visceral fat reduction in young adults with normal weight. The trial utilized a within-subject control design and gathered comprehensive data, including:

- Baseline participant characteristics
- Continuous monitoring data
- Dietary adherence
- Recovery-period health outcomes

Leveraging this data, the tool applies advanced predictive models to provide personalized, evidence-based dietary recommendations and predictions for optimizing metabolic health.

## Study Design

The study employed a within-subject control design, where participants were assigned to one of seven dietary groups. The interventions were implemented over a four-week period, with regular monitoring of multi-dimensional health outcomes.

### Participant Characteristics

The trial enrolled 84 healthy young adults, aged 18-35 years, including both male and female participants. Comprehensive baseline measurements were taken, including:

- Demographic factors
- Body composition
- Biochemical and metabolic factors

### Measurement Methods

- **VFA Measurement**: Using the InBody body composition analyzer
- **Metabolic Factors**: Evaluated with the VMAX metabolic cart
- **Biochemical Indicators**: Assessed through complete blood count and blood chemistry analysis
- **Follow-up Assessments**: Conducted at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 32 weeks

## Dietary Regimens

The tool evaluates seven different dietary approaches:

1. **Balanced Diet (100% Energy)**: Balanced Diet with 100% guideline intake
2. **TRF 16:8 (100% Energy)**: Time-Restricted Eating with 16:8 schedule and 100% caloric intake
3. **ADF (75% Energy)**: Alternate day fasting with 125% caloric intake on non-fasting days and 25% caloric intake on fasting days
4. **TRF 16:8 (75% Energy)**: Time-Restricted Eating with 16:8 schedule and 75% caloric intake
5. **IF 5:2 (75% Energy)**: Intermittent Fasting 5:2 with 95% caloric intake on non-fasting days and 25% caloric intake on two continuous fasting days
6. **CCR (75% Energy)**: Continuous Caloric Restriction with 75% caloric intake
7. **VLCD (45% Energy)**: Very-Low-Calorie Diet with 45% caloric intake

## Usage

### Task 1: Optimal Dietary Regimen Prediction

1. Navigate to the "Prediction" page
2. Select "Task 1: Predict optimal dietary regimen"
3. Fill in the required personal information:
   - Demographic factors (Age, Sex, Birth Weight)
   - Body composition measurements
   - Metabolic indicators
   - Lifestyle factors
4. Submit the form to receive personalized dietary recommendations

### Task 2: Current Diet Continuation Prediction

1. Navigate to the "Prediction" page
2. Select "Task 2: Predict VFA change with current diet"
3. Fill in the same set of personal information
4. Submit the form to see predicted VFA changes if continuing current dietary habits

## Model Architecture

The tool uses machine learning models trained on comprehensive clinical trial data. The models incorporate multiple feature categories:

- **Demographic & Birth Factors**: Sex, Age, Birth Weight
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Nap Duration
- **Body Composition Factors**: TBW/FFM, Trunk FFM %, Leg BFM
- **Immune Cell Factors**: Lymphocyte %, Monocyte Count
- **Metabolic Factors**: Respiratory Quotient
- **Liver & Kidney Function Factors**: ALP, Urea

## Energy Calculation

### BMR Calculation (Mifflin-St Jeor Equation)

- **For Men**: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) + 5
- **For Women**: BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(years) - 161

### Activity Factors for Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

- **Sedentary** (little or no exercise): BMR × 1.2
- **Lightly Active** (light exercise): BMR × 1.35
- **Moderately Active** (moderate exercise): BMR × 1.5
- **Very Active** (hard exercise): BMR × 1.75
- **Super Active** (very hard exercise): BMR × 1.9

### Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2022

- **Adult Men**: ~2250 kcal daily
- **Adult Women**: ~1800 kcal daily
- **Macronutrient Distribution**:
  - **Carbohydrates**: 50-65% of total energy
  - **Proteins**: 10-15% of total energy
  - **Fats**: 20-30% of total energy
